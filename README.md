Java Data Structures
================

Playground for data structures in Java.

* Unbalanced binary search tree, linked list implementation.
  * [Ephemeral version](src/main/java/com/dhwebco/datastructs/BinarySearchTree.java), which is updated in-place.
  * [Persistent version](src/main/java/com/dhwebco/datastructs/persistent/PersistentBinarySearchTree.java), which uses path sharing to remain immutable.
* [Trie](src/main/java/com/dhwebco/datastructs/Trie.java).
* Hash table implementations.
  * An [implementation that uses separate chaining as the collision strategy](src/main/java/com/dhwebco/datastructs/SeparateChainingHashTable.java). Backed by a dynamically growing array.
