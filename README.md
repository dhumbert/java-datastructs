Java Data Structures
================

Playground for data structures in Java.

* Unbalanced binary search tree, linked list implementation.
  * Ephemeral version, which is updated in-place.
  * Persistent version, which uses path sharing to remain immutable.
* Trie.
* Hash table implementations.
  * One implementation that uses separate chaining as the collision strategy. Backed by a dynamically growing array.
